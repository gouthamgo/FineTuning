**FineTuning** is a toolkit designed for speed, compatibility, and extensibility. Whether you're experimenting on a single GPU or scaling across a multi-node cluster, our library provides a streamlined API to apply powerful, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to your models.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üß© Plug-and-Play:** Easily apply different fine-tuning methods by changing a single configuration parameter.
*   **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance Optimized:** Built for high throughput and low memory overhead, making it possible to fine-tune larger models on consumer hardware.
*   **üîå Framework Agnostic:** Integrates seamlessly with popular libraries like Hugging Face `transformers` and `PyTorch`.
*   **üîß Extensible by Design:** A clear, modular structure makes it simple to add your own custom fine-tuning techniques.
*   **üéì All-in-One Resource:** Includes not just the tools, but also the guidance to help you choose the right method for your task.

## ü§î What is Fine-Tuning? (And Why LoRA?)

Before diving in, let's understand the core concepts.

### Full Fine-Tuning vs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

Imagine a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 as a brilliant, generalist expert.
*   **Full Fine-Tuning** is like re-training this expert extensively for a new, specialized job. You adjust *all* of their knowledge (billions of parameters). This is incredibly effective but requires massive amounts of data and computational power (i.e., lots of expensive GPUs). It's also costly to store a full copy of the model for every new task.

*   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** is a smarter approach. Instead of re-training the entire expert, you give them a small "notebook" with task-specific instructions. You only train the notebook, not the expert's core knowledge. This "notebook" represents a tiny fraction of the total parameters (e.g., ~0.01%).

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** is the most popular PEFT technique. It freezes the original model weights and injects small, trainable "adapter" matrices into the transformer layers. These new matrices learn the task-specific changes. This drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters, making fine-tuning faster, more memory-efficient, and easier to manage.

This library provides the standard **LoRA** method and several powerful variants built upon this core idea.

## üöÄ Supported Methods

Each method is a modular component that can be plugged into your training workflow.

| Method       | Description                                                                                                   | Best For                                                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LoRA**     | Standard Low-Rank Adaptation. The industry-standard for efficient fine-tuning.                                | General-purpose tasks, chatbots, summarization. A great starting point.        |
| **LoRA-FA**  | **F**eature-safe extension of LoRA adapted for specific transformer layers to prevent catastrophic forgetting.  | Tasks where preserving pre-trained knowledge is critical.                      |
| **Delta-LoRA** | A delta-based approach that improves efficiency by learning and applying only the *changes* to weights.     | Extremely memory-constrained environments; iterative fine-tuning.              |
| **VERA**     | **V**ector-based **R**andom **A**dapters. A highly efficient variant that uses one shared low-rank matrix.      | Scenarios requiring faster training and less VRAM, with minimal performance trade-off. |
| **LoRA+**    | An enhanced version of LoRA that uses different learning rates for its adapter matrices for improved stability. | Complex tasks that may suffer from unstable training with standard LoRA.      |

### Which Method Should I Choose?

*   **Start with `LoRA`:** It's robust, well-understood, and provides a great baseline.
*   **If you're memory-constrained:** Try `VERA` or `Delta-LoRA`. `VERA` is particularly fast and memory-friendly.
*   **If you see performance degradation on base tasks:** `LoRA-FA` can help preserve the model's original capabilities.
*   **If your training is unstable:** `LoRA+` can help stabilize the learning process and lead to better results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can install the toolkit directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install finetuning-toolkit


Ensure you have PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers installed as well:

üèéÔ∏è Quick Start

Applying a fine-tuning method is as simple as defining a configuration and wrapping your model. Here‚Äôs how to apply standard LoRA to a model from the Hugging Face Hub.

Generated python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from finetuning_toolkit import FineTuningConfig, FineTuningModel

# 1. Load your base model and tokenizer
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto" # Automatically uses available GPUs
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# 2. Define the fine-tuning configuration
# To switch methods, just change the `method` string!
config = FineTuningConfig(
    method="lora",         # The method to use: "lora", "vera", "lora_plus", etc.
    lora_r=16,             # LoRA rank (dimension of the adapter)
    lora_alpha=32,         # LoRA alpha (scaling factor)
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"] # Apply LoRA to query and value projections
)

# 3. Create the fine-tunable model
model = FineTuningModel(base_model, config)
model.print_trainable_parameters()
# Output: trainable params: 4,194,304 || all params: 6,742,609,920 || trainable%: 0.0622

# 4. Your standard PyTorch training loop here...
# (Load your dataset, use a PyTorch optimizer, and train `model`)
# optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
# ... training logic ...

# 5. Save the trained adapter weights
# This saves only the small, trained adapter, not the entire model.
model.save_adapter("./my_llama_adapter")

# You can later load this adapter for inference without re-training.

Advanced Usage: Switching Methods

The power of this toolkit is its modularity. Want to try VERA instead? Just change the config!

Generated python
# Switch from LoRA to VERA by changing one line
config = FineTuningConfig(
    method="vera",         # Now using VERA!
    lora_r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
    # VERA has its own specific parameters if needed
    # vera_d_initial=0.1,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"]
)

# The rest of your code remains the same
model = FineTuningModel(base_model, config)
# ... continue with your training loop ...
