    "## 🎤 Part 3: Interview Prep - Top 20 Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1: Explain fine-tuning to a non-technical person**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer:**\n",
    "> \"Fine-tuning is like taking a generally educated person and teaching them a specialized skill. The model already knows language and patterns, but we train it on specific data to make it an expert in one area. For example, BERT knows general English, but we fine-tune it on medical texts to make it understand medical terminology.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Use analogy\n",
    "- Mention it's more efficient than training from scratch\n",
    "- Give concrete example\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2: What's the difference between training and fine-tuning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer:**\n",
    "> \"Training from scratch means learning everything - you initialize random weights and train on massive datasets (like GPT-3's 45TB). Fine-tuning starts with a pre-trained model that already understands language, and we adjust it for a specific task using much less data - maybe just 1000 examples instead of millions. It's faster, cheaper, and usually gives better results for specialized tasks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Cost difference\n",
    "- Data requirements\n",
    "- When to use each\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3: How do you handle class imbalance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer:**\n",
    "> \"I use several techniques:\n",
    "> 1. **Class weights** - Give more weight to minority class in loss function\n",
    "> 2. **Oversampling** - Duplicate minority examples or use SMOTE\n",
    "> 3. **Undersampling** - Reduce majority class (if enough data)\n",
    "> 4. **Focal loss** - Focuses on hard examples\n",
    "> \n",
    "> In my support bot project, I had 80% billing questions and 20% technical. I used class weights (0.6 for billing, 2.0 for technical) and it improved F1 score on technical questions from 0.65 to 0.82.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Multiple solutions\n",
    "- Real project example with numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4: What's overfitting and how do you prevent it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer:**\n",
    "> \"Overfitting is when your model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns - like a student memorizing answers instead of understanding concepts. Signs are high training accuracy but low test accuracy.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Prevention:\n",
    "> 1. **More data** - Best solution if possible\n",
    "> 2. **Regularization** - L2 weight decay (I use 0.01)\n",
    "> 3. **Dropout** - Random neuron deactivation\n",
    "> 4. **Early stopping** - Stop when validation loss stops improving\n",
    "> 5. **Data augmentation** - Create variations\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In my projects, I always split data 80/10/10 (train/val/test) and monitor validation loss. If it diverges from training loss, I add more regularization.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5: How do you choose hyperparameters?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer:**\n",
    "> \"I start with proven defaults:\n",
    "> - Learning rate: 3e-5 for fine-tuning (LoRA can use 1e-4)\n",
    "> - Batch size: 16-32 (depending on GPU memory)\n",
    "> - Epochs: 3-5\n",
    "> - Weight decay: 0.01\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Then I systematically tune:\n",
    "> 1. **Grid search** for small spaces (3-4 values per param)\n",
    "> 2. **Random search** for larger spaces\n",
    "> 3. **Learning rate finder** - Plot loss vs LR\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In my sentiment API, I tested 3 learning rates (1e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5) and found 3e-5 gave best val accuracy (87% vs 85% and 84%).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6: Explain LoRA and why it's useful**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer:**\n",
    "> \"LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Instead of updating all model weights, we freeze the original model and add small 'adapter' matrices.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Example: A 768×768 layer has 590K parameters. LoRA adds two 768×8 and 8×768 matrices = only 12K parameters (98% reduction).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Benefits:\n",
    "> - Train 7B models on consumer GPUs\n",
    "> - 75% less memory\n",
    "> - Same accuracy as full fine-tuning\n",
    "> - Tiny model files (4MB vs 400MB)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> I used QLoRA (4-bit LoRA) to fine-tune LLaMA-7B on a free Colab GPU, which normally needs 28GB+.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q7: How do you deploy ML models?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer:**\n",
    "> \"I've deployed models three ways:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **HuggingFace Spaces** - Quick demos, free, perfect for portfolio\n",
    "> 2. **FastAPI + Docker** - Production-grade, what I used for my support bot:\n",
    ">    - FastAPI endpoint with request/response validation\n",
    ">    - Docker container for consistency\n",
    ">    - Deployed to AWS ECS with auto-scaling\n",
    ">    - Added health checks, monitoring, rate limiting\n",
    "> 3. **AWS Lambda** - Serverless for variable traffic, pay-per-request\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For the support bot, I chose FastAPI + ECS because we needed consistent low latency (<200ms) and wanted full control over the infrastructure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Multiple deployment options\n",
    "- Trade-offs of each\n",
    "- Real project example\n",
    "- Business reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q8: How do you monitor models in production?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer:**\n",
    "> \"I track four categories of metrics:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Performance Metrics:**\n",
    ">    - Latency (p50, p95, p99)\n",
    ">    - Throughput (requests/second)\n",
    ">    - Error rate\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. **Model Metrics:**\n",
    ">    - Prediction distribution (detect drift)\n",
    ">    - Confidence scores (dropping = model degrading)\n",
    ">    - Per-class accuracy\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. **Business Metrics:**\n",
    ">    - Automation rate (% answered without escalation)\n",
    ">    - User satisfaction\n",
    ">    - Cost savings\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. **Infrastructure:**\n",
    ">    - CPU/memory usage\n",
    ">    - Instance health\n",
    ">\n",
    "> I use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for dashboards. Set alerts when confidence drops below 75% or latency exceeds 500ms.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q9: What would you do if model accuracy drops in production?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer:**\n",
    "> \"First, I'd investigate:\n",
    "> 1. **Check data drift** - Are inputs different from training data?\n",
    "> 2. **Review recent changes** - New deployment? Config change?\n",
    "> 3. **Analyze errors** - Which examples are failing?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Then fix:\n",
    "> 1. **Quick fix** - Revert to previous model version\n",
    "> 2. **Short term** - Collect failed examples, add to training data\n",
    "> 3. **Long term** - Set up continuous retraining pipeline\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Example: In my support bot, I noticed accuracy dropped from 87% to 79% after 3 months. I found new product features weren't in training data. I collected 500 new Q&A pairs, retrained, and accuracy recovered to 88%.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q10: Explain your ML project end-to-end**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOOD Answer (Customer Support Bot):**\n",
    "> \"**Problem:** Support team drowning in 1000+ daily tickets, 70% repetitive\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Solution:** AI bot to auto-answer common questions\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Process:**\n",
    "> 1. **Data:** Scraped 10K FAQ pairs from docs + support history\n",
    "> 2. **Preparation:** Cleaned HTML, deduplicated, split 80/10/10\n",
    "> 3. **Model:** Fine-tuned DistilBERT (chose for speed: 180ms vs BERT's 400ms)\n",
    "> 4. **Training:** 5 epochs, lr=3e-5, achieved 87% accuracy\n",
    "> 5. **Production:** FastAPI + Docker on AWS ECS\n",
    "> 6. **Features:** Confidence scoring (75% threshold), smart escalation, monitoring\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Results:**\n",
    "> - 70% automation rate\n",
    "> - 2 hours → 2 seconds response time\n",
    "> - $50K/year saved\n",
    "> - 30% higher customer satisfaction\n",
