    "### 1. **Start Simple**\n",
    "Always try standard loss first. Only customize if you have a good reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Monitor Multiple Metrics**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Don't just look at loss!\n",
    "metrics = {\n",
    "    'loss': loss.item(),\n",
    "    'accuracy': accuracy,\n",

    "### 3. **Validate on Business Metrics**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Medical diagnosis\n",
    "false_negatives = count_fn(predictions, labels)\n",
    "if false_negatives > threshold:\n",
    "    # Increase weight on that class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Experiment with Hyperparameters**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Try different values\n",
    "for gamma in [0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0]:\n",
    "    loss_fn = FocalLoss(gamma=gamma)\n",
    "    # Train and compare\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Combine Losses**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sometimes you want multiple objectives\n",
    "total_loss = 0.7 * classification_loss + 0.3 * regularization_loss\n",
