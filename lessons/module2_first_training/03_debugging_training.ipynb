    "1. **Errors are NORMAL** - You'll see hundreds. Don't panic!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start small** - Get it working on 100 examples before trying 100,000\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **One change at a time** - Change learning rate OR batch size, not both!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Google is your friend** - 99% of errors, someone else hit first\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check your data FIRST** - Most \"model problems\" are actually data problems\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visualize everything** - Plot loss, plot predictions, plot distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Save your work** - Nothing worse than losing a good model\n",
