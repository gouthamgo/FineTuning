    "\n",
    "Okay, so you trained your first model in the last lesson. Awesome!\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the thing: That was like cooking a recipe for the first time with the default settings. It worked, but...\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if you could make it EVEN BETTER?**\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what we're doing today. We're going to learn about **hyperparameters** - the secret knobs and dials that control how your model learns.\n",

    "🎮 **Training a model = Playing a video game**\n",

    "## 🎛️ What Even Are Hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are settings you choose BEFORE training starts. They control:\n",
    "- How fast the model learns\n",
    "- How long it trains\n",
    "- How much data it sees at once\n",
    "- And more!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the most important ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Learning Rate** 🏃\n",
    "**How fast should the model learn?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Too high? → Model learns wrong things (overshoots)\n",
    "- Too low? → Takes forever to learn\n",
    "- Just right? → Learns efficiently!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like walking to a destination\n",
    "- Too fast = you run past it\n",
    "- Too slow = takes forever\n",
    "- Just right = you get there efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical values:** 1e-5 to 5e-5 for fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Batch Size** 📦\n",
    "**How many examples to show at once?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bigger batch = faster training, more memory\n",
    "- Smaller batch = slower, less memory, sometimes better results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like reading books\n",
    "- Batch size 1 = Read one page, think, read next page\n",
    "- Batch size 32 = Read 32 pages, then think about all of them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical values:** 8, 16, 32 (limited by GPU memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Number of Epochs** 🔄\n",
    "**How many times to see all the data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Too few = underfitting (doesn't learn enough)\n",
    "- Too many = overfitting (memorizes instead of learning)\n",
    "- Just right = learns the patterns!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Studying for an exam\n",
    "- 1 epoch = Read the book once\n",
    "- 10 epochs = Read it 10 times\n",
    "- Too many = You memorize exact words but don't understand\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical values:** 3-5 for fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Weight Decay** ⚖️\n",
    "**How much to prevent overfitting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a regularization penalty that keeps the model from getting too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical values:** 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Warmup Steps** 🌅\n",
    "**Should we start slow?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of jumping to full learning rate immediately, gradually increase it at the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like warming up before exercise - you don't sprint immediately!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical values:** 10% of total training steps"
