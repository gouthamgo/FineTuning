- Document type classification - Train a model to identify if a text snippet is from an invoice, contract, email, report, etc. This builds directly toward your PDF tagger goal.
- Topic classification - Take short text snippets and classify them as tech, business, health, sports, etc. Easy to get data for and see if it's working.
- Email intent classification - Classify emails as urgent, informational, action-needed, etc. Super practical if you have email data.
- Product review sentiment - Beyond just positive/negative, classify as excited, disappointed, neutral, confused. More nuanced than basic sentiment.
