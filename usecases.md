- Document type classification - Train a model to identify if a text snippet is from an invoice, contract, email, report, etc. This builds directly toward your PDF tagger goal.
- Topic classification - Take short text snippets and classify them as tech, business, health, sports, etc. Easy to get data for and see if it's working.
- Email intent classification - Classify emails as urgent, informational, action-needed, etc. Super practical if you have email data.
- Product review sentiment - Beyond just positive/negative, classify as excited, disappointed, neutral, confused. More nuanced than basic sentiment.

I could try :
Healthcare note analysis – Extract medical entities (like symptoms or medications) from doctor's notes to automate patient record structuring. 
Environmental education – Generate simple explanations of concepts like greenhouse gases for eco-awareness apps or school tools. 
Niche customer support – Fine-tune for specific product FAQs (e.g., bicycle repair guides) to power low-cost chatbots for small businesses. 
Low-resource language translation – Adapt for regional dialects (e.g., rural Indonesian variants) to enable offline translation on budget smartphones. 
Instruction-based tutoring – Create a math/grammar helper for offline classrooms by training on beginner-level exercises. 
IoT sensor interpretation – Convert raw sensor data (e.g., soil moisture levels) into plain-English alerts for farming devices. 
Mobile document summarization – Condense long articles or reports into bullet points for news apps running on older phones. 
Handwritten form digitization – Process scanned forms (e.g., surveys) by fine-tuning to recognize and transcribe structured text fields. 
Voice-controlled smart home – Power basic voice commands (e.g., "Turn off lights") on Raspberry Pi without cloud dependency. 
Spam filter for messaging apps – Train on custom spam patterns (e.g., phishing links in local languages) for on-device message screening.
