What Unsloth actually does:
Instead of updating the entire massive model (like rewriting a whole encyclopedia), it adds tiny "adapter layers" that learn your specific task. Think of it like putting sticky notes on specific pages instead of rewriting the whole book.

 before Unsloth:
# Old way - slow, memory hungry
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b")
# This takes 14GB of memory and trains slow as hell

With Unsloth:

from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/llama-2-7b-bnb-4bit",  # 4-bit quantized
    max_seq_length = 2048,
    dtype = None,
    load_in_4bit = True,
)

# Same model, but now it uses 4GB instead of 14GB
# And trains 2-5x faster
